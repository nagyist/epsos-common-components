# epSOS Common Components Description #

The [epSOS project](http://www.epsos.eu) has released interoperability specifications (Common Components Specification) for national Contact Points (NCPs) to interact and support epSOS defined services such as patient summary and prescription. epSOS has also established a testing process for testing compliant implementations of these specifications, and ensure their interoperability.

## Project Dissemination ##

The general dissemination of the epSOS project is carried out at http://www.epsos.eu, and all questions or comments regarding the project as a whole or any of the deliverables should be directed to the communication channels defined by the epSOS project.
This open source project is a software implementation of these interoperability specifications.  It is an example of their realization in software components that support building of an NCP (national contact point) by participating nations.

## Artifacts Publication ##

All artifacts published by this open source project and its subprojects will be made available on http://www.joinup.eu/.
This open source project will primarily provide the software components needed in an NCP, and integration tests that demonstrate their interdependencies. This will include build scripts, third party components, general instructions on deploying and notes on system prerequisites. Furthermore, the project _may_ provide implementation notes, comments on the epSOS interoperability specification and general discussion related to the implementation of the software components. Such notes should be viewed in the context of a development work in progress, and may change over time or completely disappear.

## License notes ##

The components developed in this project are developed under the ASLv2 and the GPLv3.

# OpenNCP Introduction #

The OpenNCP is thought of as a conceptual collection of the common components with the aim of constructing a NCP. The repositories hosted here represents the effort to meet this end.

## OpenNCP miniprojects ##

The responsibility of the development and testing of the components have been divided into several miniprojects, each responsible of a logical collection of components. We maintain a list of the mini projects at [the wiki](https://openncp.atlassian.net/wiki) in which the individual miniproject pages can be found.

## Getting the components ##

Everything obtained from the google code repositories are considered to be under development and the miniprojects can not guarantee that code obtained from this site at any given time can either build, be brought to run, run correctly or even corrupt data upon deployment. Tested artifacts will be made available on http://www.joinup.eu. See the [disclaimer](https://openncp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ODC/Disclaimer)

## Development ##

If you would like to participate in the development of the common components, please read [this page on contributing](https://openncp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ODC/Contributing) and [this page on the prerequisites for building the components](https://openncp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ODC/Code+Development).
