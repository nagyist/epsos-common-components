# Code stability #

The project will make no guarantees for stable code in the repositories except for release tags.

Code obtained from the google code repositories should be considered under development and the miniprojects can not guarantee that code obtained from this site at any given time can either build, be brought to run, run correctly or even corrupt data upon deployment.

The project will make its releases available on http://joinup.eu as maven artifacts.
